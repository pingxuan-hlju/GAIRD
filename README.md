# GAIRD

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of Graph reasoning method based on affinity identification and representation decoupling for predicting lncRNA-disease associations (GAIRD).

GAIRD designed homogeneous and heterogeneous distribution learning modules to combine information from different neighborhood scopes, and a representation decoupling strategy was established to distinguish the contributions of node attributes and network topology to the lncRNA-disease association prediction task.

## How to Run the Code
1. Data Preprocessing: generating training set, test set, adjacency matrix, attribute matrix, shortest path distance matrix
    ```
    python preprocessing.py
    ```
2. Train and test the model.
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

The other details can be seen in the paper and the codes.
